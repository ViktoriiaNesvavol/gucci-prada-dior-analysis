<h1>LLM Prompts<br />and enrichments</h1>
									
</header>
<i>In the following section we asked Gemini and ChatGPT for clarification and refinements about some of the queries that are shown in the previous page.</i>
<div class="image main"><img src="images/genericfront.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<hr />
<h3 id="optional-brands-location-and-founder">1️⃣ OPTIONAL: Brands, Location, and Founder</h3>
<p>For the first query, we asked LLMs for confirmation about the founding locations of the brands.</p>
								
<p><strong>Few-shot prompting:</strong>Christian Dior --> Paris, Prada --> Milan, Gucci --></p>

<h3>GEMINI</h3>

<h3>CHATGPT</h3>   

<img src="images/Chatgpt 1.png"> 

<p>Both LLMs confirm that the founding location of Gucci is Florence. However, in the previous query, the result retrieved is the following: </p>

<img src="images/Immagine 1,1.png" width="900">
								
<p>So, the founding location of Gucci appears twice. Therefore, we asked LLMs to refine the query in order to get a unique result: </p>

<img src="images/query 1.png" width="900">

<p>The result is now the following: </p>

<img src="images/Immagine 1.png" width="900">

<p>LLMs helped us retrieve a more refined and correct result. </p>

<hr>

<h3 id="optional-brands-location-and-founder">3️⃣ UNION: Associated People for Gucci or Prada</h3>
<p>The purpose of the third query was to combine results from different relationship types, and the result is the following:</p>

<p>We asked Gemini and ChatGPT what kind of relationship there is between person and brand, e.g. “founder”, “creative director”, etc. using a zero-shot prompting technique</p>

<p><strong>Zero-shot prompting:</strong> Who is the founder of Prada?</p>

<h3>GEMINI</h3>

<h3>CHATGPT</h3>   

<img src="images/Chatgpt 2.png">

<p>We then asked the LLM to transform this information into RDF text in order to get a more accurate result:</p>

<img src="images/Query 2.png">

<p>And this is the final, more detailed and refined result:</p>

<img src="images/Results 2.png" width="900">

<hr>

<h3 id="filter-regex-gucci-silk-clothing-items">4️⃣ FILTER & REGEX: Gucci Silk Clothing Items</h3

<p>This query's purpose was to retrieve results displaying silk clothes related to Gucci. The result was the following:</p>

<img src="images/Results 3.png" width="900">

<p>We asked Gemini and ChatGPT for ways to enrich our query, employing a chain of thought prompting technique:</p>
<p><strong>Chain of thought prompting:</strong> We previously wrote a SPARQL query in Wikidata that retrieved Gucci products made of silk. Now we want to know more about the properties of this fabric, such as color, pattern, or other descriptive attributes.
Step by step:
What are possible RDF properties or predicates that could describe characteristics like color or pattern in fashion items or textiles?
How might these be represented in Wikidata?
How can we update or expand the original SPARQL query to retrieve these additional features for Gucci’s silk items?
Please explain your reasoning clearly at each step, and provide the updated SPARQL query at the end.</p>

<p>Both Gemini and ChatGPT provided interesting reasoning and accurate queries. As can be observed when running both queries, Wikidata likely does not contain any information about the colour and possible patterns. However, some of the clothing items include information about the material as it can be seen in the result of the ChatGPT query:</p>
