<h1>LLM Prompts<br/> and enrichments</h1>
									
</header>
<i>In the following section, we consulted Gemini and ChatGPT to clarify and refine several SPARQL queries introduced on the previous page.</i>
<div class="image main"><img src="images/genericfront.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<hr />
<h3 id="optional-brands-location-and-founder">1Ô∏è‚É£ Query Refinement: Removing Duplicates</h3>
<p>The first query's purpose was to use OPTIONAL to retrieve brands and their founding locations, optionally including the founder's name. We then asked LLMs for confirmation about the founding locations of the brands:</p>
								
<p><strong>Few-shot prompting:</strong> Christian Dior ‚Üí Paris; Prada ‚Üí Milan; Gucci ‚Üí</p>

<h3>GEMINI</h3>

<br>
<h3>CHATGPT</h3>   

<img src="images/Chatgpt 1.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>Both LLMs confirm that the founding location of Gucci is Florence. However, the result retrieved by running the query is the following: </p>

<img src="images/Immagine 1,1.png" class="screenshot">
<br>								
<p>The founding location of Gucci appears twice. Therefore, we asked LLMs to refine the query to avoid the duplicate: </p>

<img src="images/query 1.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>The result is now the following: </p>

<img src="images/Immagine 1.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>LLMs helped us retrieve a more refined and correct result. </p>

<hr>

<h3 id="optional-brands-location-and-founder">3Ô∏è‚É£ UNION: Associated People for Gucci or Prada</h3>
<p>The purpose of the third query was to combine results from different relationship types, and the result is the following:</p>

<img src="images/Union.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>We asked Gemini and ChatGPT to identify the type of relationship (e.g., ‚Äúfounder,‚Äù ‚Äúcreative director‚Äù) between each person and their associated brand.</p>

<p><strong>Zero-shot prompting:</strong> Who is the founder of Prada?</p>

<h3>GEMINI</h3>

<img src="images/Gemini 2.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<h3>CHATGPT</h3>   

<img src="images/Chatgpt 2.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>We then asked the LLM to transform this information into RDF text in order to get a more accurate result:</p>

<img src="images/Query 2.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>And this is the final, more detailed and refined result:</p>

<img src="images/Results 2.png" class="screenshot">

<hr>

<h3 id="filter-regex-gucci-silk-clothing-items">4Ô∏è‚É£ FILTER & REGEX: Gucci Silk Clothing Items</h3

<p>This query's purpose was to retrieve results displaying silk clothes related to Gucci. The result was the following:</p>

<img src="images/Results 3.png" class="screenshot">
<br>
<p>We asked Gemini and ChatGPT for ways to enrich our query, employing a chain of thought prompting technique:</p>
<p><strong>Chain of thought prompting:</strong> We previously wrote a SPARQL query in Wikidata that retrieved Gucci products made of silk. Now we want to know more about the properties of this fabric, such as color, pattern, or other descriptive attributes.
Step by step:
What are possible RDF properties or predicates that could describe characteristics like color or pattern in fashion items or textiles?
How might these be represented in Wikidata?
How can we update or expand the original SPARQL query to retrieve these additional features for Gucci‚Äôs silk items?
Please explain your reasoning clearly at each step, and provide the updated SPARQL query at the end.</p>

<p>Both Gemini and ChatGPT provided interesting reasoning and accurate queries. As can be observed when running both queries, Wikidata likely does not contain any information about the colour and possible patterns. However, some of the clothing items include information about the material as it can be seen in the result of the ChatGPT query:</p>

<h3>üîç Conclusion</h3>
<p>This exploration demonstrated how LLMs can support query refinement, clarify ambiguous results, and propose semantic enrichments. While the LLMs showed promising reasoning capabilities, some limitations in Wikidata's content were also observed.</p>
